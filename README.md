# Autonomous Car project in CPSC552 Data Mining 
This Repository contains the setting up of an autonomous raspberry pi-car and training it with data mining models.

# Contents:
  1. Introduction
  2. Assembling the Autonomous Car
  3. Setting-up Raspberry Pi
``4. Training Model for Traffic Signs using CNN

# Introduction:
In this project, we will be working on the implementation of data mining Techniques- Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) for real-world problem Autonomous vehicle. For this project, we used the Smart Video Car Kit V2.0 for Raspberry Pi. We will Assemble the car, Set up Raspberry Pi, Train a Model for detecting traffic signs and act accordingly.

#Setting-up of Autonomous Car


We can Assemble the Autonomous Car with the following steps
Configuration of Raspberry Pi
Training a Model
